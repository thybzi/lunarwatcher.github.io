After a while of initially fucking around with various solutions, I settled on samba, because it's a major standard.

That was actually a major factor when deciding on the protocol; if I can avoid messing with fstab and avoid manual mounting, I'd be really happy.</p><div><a href=/posts/2022/03/06/network-shares-are-weird.html>Read More...</a></div></div><div class=article><h1><a href=https://lunarwatcher.github.io/posts/2022/01/02/devlogs-2022-week-52-3.html>Devlogs: 2022, week 52-3</a></h1><div class=meta-container><time class=post-meta>January 2nd, 2022</time><br><span class=post-meta>This post is a part of these series:

I have a few projects that've been struggling.
